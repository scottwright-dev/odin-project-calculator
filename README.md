### Description

This is the final project from The Odin Project foundations course. The task was to create a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is designed to handle decimal number user input and to allow chaining of calculations. The design is clean and modern, featuring a responsive grid layout for the buttons and an easy-to-read display for the input and output values.

### Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Handling of decimal numbers
- Clear and delete buttons for managing input
- Responsive grid layout for buttons
- Modern and clean design

### Challenges
- Implementing basic arithmetic operations while handling edge cases, such as dividing by zero and chaining calculations
- Managing and updating user input and output in a clear and efficient manner
- Ensuring the calculator display does not overflow with large numbers

### Thoughts and Observations
Building the calculator provided a good opportunity to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and user input validation using vanilla JavaScript. It also reinforced the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps and the value of testing and debugging code regularly.

The project helped to solidify my understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScript and the importance of clear and efficient code when handling user input and performing calculations. I have noticed my code readability has improved during this project, although there is still room for improvement. I also want to refine my git commit procedure, as I perhaps pushed too frequently in this project and could reduce this in future for more concise documentation. However, I made a point of making these commits as clear as possible with message headers and body for context. 

I plan to return to this project in future to implement a percentage function. I will also refine the UX on mobile devices as while it currently functions as intended on desktop and some mobile devices, my testing has revealed there are still some issues on iPhone displays. However, as it stands I feel this completes the brief well enough to my current level of understanding.

Additionally, I look forward to learning how to implement my own TDD protocol via Jest as I realised the value of test-driven development and the efficiencies it would bring to a project such as this.

### Conclusion
This project has provided an opportunity to apply the knowledge I have built up so far in the Odin Project foundations course. It allowed me to apply fundamental JavaScript skills while building a functional and visually appealing calculator, as well as practising DOM manipulation, event handling, and user input validation.
